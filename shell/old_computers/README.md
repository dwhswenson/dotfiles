# `old_computers`

This contains config files I created a very long time ago for computers that I
no longer have access to. I keep these around mainly in case I ever think "oh
yeah, I had to solve a similar problem with the research computer I used back
to 2003" (which is... not likely -- but they're small text files, so why not
keep them around?)
