# bashrc_dynamiq
#   bashrc stuff for any computer that runs dynamiq (technically, dynamiq2)

# NOTE: the environment variable ${DYNQ} should be set prior to loading
# this. 
# ${DYN2DIR} : base directory for dynamiq
# ${DYNQ}    : ${DYN2DIR}/trunk

# Two tricks for comparing branches in dynamiq2 
# 1. identify which files differ
alias trunkcompare='diff -q -r . ${DYNQ} | grep -v "\.o" | grep -v "\.dSYM" | grep "Files.*differ"'
# 2. opendiff to merge them: by default, we merge FROM trunk TO this file
function trunkdiff { 
    opendiff $1 ${DYNQ}/$1 -merge $1
}
